It provides safety and security in a universe that offers none for humans.Me, I don\u2019t really *need* a husband. I just want one. And I want one man in particular. There\u2019s a new guy in town, a by-the-books military man named Rektar. Every day I show up to his office and flirt with him. I bring pies. I twirl my hair. I make it very, very obvious what I want.Rektar is patient, and gentle for all his hulking form. He\u2019d be a great husband. He\u2019s also completely clueless that I\u2019m flirting with him.So it\u2019s time for me to be a little bit bolder\u2026",
