But some of his actions left unexpected consequences. His parents\u2014and many other adults\u2014are still stuck as teenagers. And now Jonah has a new sibling, an identical twin brother named Jordan.As odd as all this is for Jonah, it\u2019s beyond confusing for Jordan. How does everyone in his family have memories of Jonah when he doesn\u2019t? How can his annoying kid sister Katherine speak so expertly about time travel\u2014and have people from the future treating her with respect? A few rash moves by Jordan send them all into the future\u2014and into danger. What if he\u2019s also the only one who can get them back to safety, once and for all?",
