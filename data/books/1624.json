    "description": "The Crescent Moon Kingdoms, home to djenn and ghuls, holy warriors and heretics, are at the boiling point of a power struggle between the iron-fisted Khalif and the mysterious master thief known as the Falcon Prince. In the midst of this brewing rebellion a series of brutal supernatural murders strikes at the heart of the Kingdoms. It is up to a handful of heroes to learn the truth behind these killings:Doctor Adoulla Makhslood, \u201cthe last real ghul hunter in the great city of Dhamsawaat,\u201d just wants a quiet cup of tea. Three score and more years old, he has grown weary of hunting monsters and saving lives, and is more than ready to retire from his dangerous and demanding vocation. But when an old flame\u2019s family is murdered, Adoulla is drawn back to the hunter\u2019s path.Raseed bas Raseed, Adoulla\u2019s young assistant, is a hidebound holy warrior whose prowess is matched only by his piety. But even as Raseed\u2019s sword is tested by ghuls and manjackals, his soul is tested when he and Adoulla cross paths with the tribeswoman Zamia.Zamia Badawi, Protector of the Band, has been gifted with the near-mythical power of the lion-shape, but shunned by her people for daring to take up a man\u2019s title. She lives only to avenge her father\u2019s death. Until she learns that Adoulla and his allies also hunt her father\u2019s killer. Until she meets Raseed.When they learn that the murders and the Falcon Prince\u2019s brewing revolution are connected, the companions must race against time\u2014and struggle against their own misgivings\u2014to save the life of a vicious despot. In so doing they discover a plot for the Throne of the Crescent Moon that threatens to turn Dhamsawaat, and the world itself, into a blood-soaked ruin.",
