Set in New Mexico and California, the novel features three teens who fall through a cave at Carlsbad Caverns in New Mexico while on a field trip. They are plunged into a frightening parallel universe\u2014seven weeks in the past, in which their \"normal\" worlds of family and high school remain the same\u2026except for the fact that no medicine exists and when people die in the street they are picked up and disposed of.",
