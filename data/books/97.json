He\u2019s all work and no fun, according to his brother and partner, Jadzion. And he\u2019s all business as he tracks down his latest target on some filthy backwater planet called Earth. He\u2019s got two diurnal cycles to take out his target, so there\u2019s not a lot of time for shenanigans.He didn\u2019t expect to find his true mate during the middle of this hit. He didn\u2019t expect her to be a stunning human female who could gentle his stern demands. And he didn\u2019t expect to be reduced to a raging, rutting beast on this mission. Can he convince his innocent mate to return with him to his home planet before his time is up, or will he be forced to steal her? ",
