Its companion series \u2013 Alt.Chronicles, The Illustrated Chronicles and Chronicle Worlds \u2013 are similarly ground-breaking in their coverage of less mainstream tropes such as alternative history and shared universes.  Created by award-winning author Samuel Peralta, and edited by some of the most-respected editors in the genre, each volume brings together work from visionary new voices and from the grandmasters of modern science fiction and fantasy.  This Future Chronicles Special Edition volume is a compendium of stories selected from the Chronicles\u2019 standalone titles, and includes five new stories, never before published, from some of today\u2019s best writers in speculative fiction.",
