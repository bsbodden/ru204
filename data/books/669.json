But Lea\u2019s perfect life is turned upside down when she spots her estranged father on a crowded sidewalk. His return marks the beginning of her downfall as she is drawn into his mysterious world of the Suicide Club, a network of powerful individuals and rebels who reject society\u2019s pursuit of immortality, and instead chose to live\u2014and die\u2014on their own terms.

How can such a young writer know all these things? Rachel Heng\u2019s first novel is as keen as a sharpened blade. Suicide Club is on the money about where our current obsessions are leading us and yet she makes us care about her characters in deep and old-fashioned ways. It reminded me again and again of Orwell and Huxley.
