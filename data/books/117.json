    "description": "Look out! Here comes Rex! Children who love to construct \u2014 and those who love to destroy \u2014 will relate to this kid-pleasing tale that builds to a smashing finale.Gizmo, Sprinkles, and Wild are fed up. Every time they build something with their blocks, Rex wrecks it! Whether it\u2019s an out-of-this-world rocket, a magical heart, or the biggest, strongest, most awesomerific castle ever, Rex sends it crashing down with a \"Rawr!\" (and sometimes a sheepish\"Rawry!\"?). Isn\u2019t there any way to make playtime fun for everyone? With Rex-size humor, Ben Clanton explores the challenges of friendship, the benefits of working together, and the joys of destruction.",
