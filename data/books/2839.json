    "description": "Atticus O\u2019Sullivan, last of the Druids, doesn\u2019t care much for witches. Still, he\u2019s about to make nice with the local coven by signing a mutually beneficial nonaggression treaty\u2014when suddenly the witch population in modern-day Tempe, Arizona, quadruples overnight. And the new girls are not just bad, they\u2019re badasses with a dark history on the German side of World War II.With a fallen angel feasting on local high school students, a horde of Bacchants blowing in from Vegas with their special brand of deadly decadence, and a dangerously sexy Celtic goddess of fire vying for his attention, Atticus is having trouble scheduling the witch hunt. But aided by his magical sword, his neighbor\u2019s rocket-propelled grenade launcher, and his vampire attorney, Atticus is ready to sweep the town and show the witchy women they picked the wrong Druid to hex.",
