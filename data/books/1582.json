A young priest, Christopher Fairfax, arrives in a remote Exmoor village to conduct the funeral of his predecessor. The land around is strewn with ancient artefacts \u2013 coins, fragments of glass, human bones \u2013 which the old parson used to collect. Did his obsession with the past lead to his death?As Fairfax is drawn more deeply into the isolated community, everything he believes \u2013 about himself, his faith and the history of his world \u2013 is tested to destruction.",
