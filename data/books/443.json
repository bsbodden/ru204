    "description": "Still reeling from their experiences in Roanoke in 1600, Jonah and Katherine arrive in 1611 only moments before a mutiny on Henry Hudson\u2019s ship in the icy waters of James Bay. But things are messed up: they\u2019ve lost the real John Hudson, and they find what seems to be the fabled Northwest Passage\u2014even though they are pretty sure that that route doesn\u2019t actually exist. Will this new version of history replace the real past? Is this the end of time as we know it? With more at stake than ever before, Jonah and Katherine struggle to unravel the mysteries of 1611 and the Hudson Passage...before everything they know is lost.",
