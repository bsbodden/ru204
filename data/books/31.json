    "description": "Street urchins Atari and Oliver are out to steal bicycles, watch Giant Robot movies, and spend some Large Denominational Bills! Malinky Robot collects five tales by Eisner-nominated artist Sonny Liew (My Faith in Frankie, Wonderland,  Sense & Senisibility) featuring stinky fish, philosopher-labourers, and summer rain. A recipient of the Xeric Award grant, the Utopiales SF Festival's Best SF Album award, and featured in the acclaimed FLIGHT anthologies, Malinky Robot blends dystopian sci-fi and indie sensibilities into a uniquely charming, off-kilter world.",
