    "description": "The space station Innominata has one problem: men die there. Only no one really knows it - or at least, no one who counts. Certainly Colonel Doctor Tony Crespi has no idea; he is simply eager to work with the infamous Doctor Paul Church, who believes that a mutated strain of alien can be made to obey human will.Church's captive creatures live in a warren of tunnels. Inside that labyrinth, Crespi and Lieutenant Sharon McGuinness are about to find the true meaning of Church's experiments. With a chamber of all-too-human horrors at its dark heart, the labyrinth is a death trap - designed by a man who is attempting what no other person in the universe would dare: to bring human and alien together as one!",
