Barnes & Noble Classics pulls together a constellation of influences\u2014biographical, historical, and literary\u2014to enrich each reader's understanding of these enduring works.\u00a0The Time Machine, H. G. Wells\u2019s first novel, is a tale of Darwinian evolution taken to its extreme. Its hero, a young scientist, travels 800,000 years into the future and discovers a dying earth populated by two strange humanoid species: the brutal Morlocks and the gentle but nearly helpless Eloi.The Invisible Man mixes chilling terror, suspense, and acute psychological understanding into a tale of an equally adventurous scientist who discovers the formula for invisibility\u2014a secret that drives him mad.Immensely popular during his lifetime, H. G. Wells, along with Jules Verne, is credited with inventing science fiction. This new volume offers two of Wells\u2019s best-loved and most critically acclaimed \u201cscientific romances.\u201d In each, the author grounds his fantastical imagination in scientific fact and conjecture while lacing his narrative with vibrant action, not merely to tell a \u201cripping yarn,\u201d but to offer a biting critique on the world around him. \u201cThe strength of Mr. Wells,\u201d wrote Arnold Bennett, \u201clies in the fact that he is not only a scientist, but a most talented student of character, especially quaint character. He will not only ingeniously describe for you a scientific miracle, but he will set down that miracle in the midst of a country village, sketching with excellent humour the inn-landlady, the blacksmith, the chemist\u2019s apprentice, the doctor, and all the other persons whom the miracle affects.\u201d\u00a0Alfred Mac Adam teaches literature at Barnard College-Columbia University. He is a translator and art critic.",
