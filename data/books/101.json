    "description": "On the cut-throat streets of Tarkis, orphaned teens like Rath end up\u00a0jailed \u2026 or dead. So when the shadowy Janus Group offers\u00a0Rath\u00a0a chance to earn riches beyond his wildest dreams,\u00a0he\u00a0seizes it. But the Janus Group is as ruthless as the elite assassins it controls.\u00a0Rath will\u00a0have to survive their grueling, off-world training, and\u00a0fulfill all fifty kills in his contract\u00a0before\u00a0a single cent\u00a0comes his way.\u00a0And ending so many lives comes with a price Rath can't anticipate. It'll\u00a0certainly cost him what's left of his innocence. It may\u00a0well\u00a0cost him his life. Interview with the Author Q - What makes the Janus Group series special?A - Growing up, I loved books like Ender's Game and the Tom Clancy Jack Ryan series. When I sat down to write the Janus Group books, I wanted to capture what I liked best about those books - sci fi thrillers or action thrillers in a fast-paced style. The series is best characterized as cyberpunk science fiction thrillers, with a little detective and police procedural elements thrown in to boot. Finally, I like my characters to be relatable, and facing overwhelming odds - the plot is action-packed, and keeps you guessing. Beware: plot twists ahead!Q - What order should I read the books in?\u00a0A - Last Pursuit is a short story set in the Janus Group world - it's the prequel, and the story that inspired me to write a full series. You can read that first (for free), then Books 1-3 (Rath's Deception, Rath's Gambit, and Rath's Reckoning) in order from there. Books 1-3 are a complete story arc - Book 3 resolves everything from Books 1 and 2.Q - Why should readers give these books a try?\u00a0A - Because the Janus Group books are fast, inventive, page-turners that kick ass and take names! They've been described as \"Jason Bourne\" meets \"Bladerunner.\" Any fans of hitman books, science fiction assassin tales, or cyberpunk thrillers will enjoy them.Q - Can readers get the whole series in one bundle?\u00a0A - Not yet - sorry, just haven't had a chance to get around to it!
