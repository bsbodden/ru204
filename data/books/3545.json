Apparently not much; until Dirk Gently, self-styled private investigator, sets out to prove the fundamental interconnectedness of all things by solving a mysterious murder, assisting a mysterious professor, unravelling a mysterious mystery, and eating a lot of pizza \u2013 not to mention saving the entire human race from extinction along the way (at no extra charge). To find out more, read this book (better still, buy it, then read it) \u2013 or contact Dirk Gently\u2019s Holistic Detective Agency. \u2018A thumping good detective-ghost-horror-whodunnit-time travel-romantic-musical-comedy epic.\u2019 The author",
