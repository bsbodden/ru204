    "description": "Lacey Chu has big dreams of becoming a companioneer\u00a0for MONCHA, the largest tech firm in North America and the company behind the \u00a0\"baku\" - a customisable smart pet that functions as a phone but makes the perfect companion too. When\u00a0Lacey finds out she hasn't been accepted into Profectus - the elite academy for cutting edge tech - it seems her dreams are over.\u00a0Worst of all, rather than getting to choose one of the advanced bakus, she\u2019s stuck with a rubbish insect one.\u00a0Then, one night, Lacey\u00a0comes across the remains of an advanced baku. Once it might\u2019ve been in the shape of a cat but it\u2019s now mangled and broken, no sign of electronic life behind its eyes. Days of work later and the baku opens its eyes. Lacey calls him Jinx \u2013 and Jinx opens up a world for her that she never even knew existed, including entry to the hallowed halls of Profecus.\u00a0Slowly but surely, Jinx becomes more than just a baku to Lacey \u2013 he becomes her perfect companion. But what is Jinx, really? His abilities far surpass anything written into his code or built into his motherboard. He seems to be more than just a robotic pet. He seems ... real.",
