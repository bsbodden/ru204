After a long and troubled war, Earth brought down the harem towers and exiled the alien lords to the moon where they rule from afar.Things have calmed down in recent history; the powerful alphas seek mates who will submit themselves voluntarily. But who would sell themselves into slavery? Who would want to become a breeder?Rourke\u2019s terminally ill mother needs a cure that\u2019s only accessible to the very rich. An omega auction can pay for it.",
