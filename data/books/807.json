But we should have known there was no way out of Furnace.All we did was slip deeper into the guts of the prison: into solitary confinement, where the real nightmares live - the warden, the Wheezers, and something much, much worse.The clock\u2019s ticking. Because if we don\u2019t escape soon they will turn us into freaks - like them. For ever.In the darkness of the hole your worst nightmares come to life.",
