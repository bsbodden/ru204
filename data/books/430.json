    "description": "Stark lives in Colour, a neighbourhood whose inhabitants like to be co-ordinated with their surroundings \u2013 a neighbourhood where spangly purple trousers are admired by the walls of buildings as you pass them. Close by is Sound, where you mustn\u2019t make any, apart from one designated hour a day when you can scream your lungs raw. Then there\u2019s Red \u2013 get off at Fuck Station Zero if you want to see a tactical nuclear battle recreated as a sales demonstration.Stark has friends in Red, which is just as well because Something is about to happen. And when a Something happens it\u2019s no good chanting \u2018Duck and cover\u2019 while cowering in a corner, because a Something is always from the past, Stark\u2019s past, and it won\u2019t go away until you face it full on.",
