That\u2019s what London constable and sorcerer\u2019s apprentice Peter Grant first notices when he examines the corpse of Cyrus Wilkins, part-time jazz drummer and full-time accountant, who dropped dead of a heart attack while playing a gig at Soho\u2019s 606 Club. The notes of the old jazz standard are rising from the body\u2014a sure sign that something about the man\u2019s death was not at all natural but instead supernatural.Body and soul. They\u2019re also what Peter will risk as he investigates a pattern of similar deaths in and around Soho. With the help of his superior officer, Detective Chief Inspector Thomas Nightingale, the last registered wizard in England, and the assistance of beautiful jazz aficionado Simone Fitzwilliam, Peter will uncover a deadly magical menace\u2014one that leads right to his own doorstep and to the squandered promise of a young jazz musician: a talented trumpet player named Richard \u201cLord\u201d Grant\u2014otherwise known as Peter\u2019s dear old dad.",
