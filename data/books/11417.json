Wells\u2019s successful career and earned him his reputation as the father of science fiction. With a speculative leap that still fires the imagination, Wells sends his brave explorer to face a future burdened with our greatest hopes...and our darkest fears. A pull of the Time Machine\u2019s lever propels him to the age of a slowly dying Earth.\u00a0 There he discovers two bizarre races\u2014the ethereal Eloi and the subterranean Morlocks\u2014who not only symbolize the duality of human nature, but offer a terrifying portrait of the men of tomorrow as well.\u00a0 Published in 1895, this masterpiece of invention captivated readers on the threshold of a new century. Thanks to Wells\u2019s expert storytelling and provocative insight, The Time Machine will continue to enthrall readers for generations to come.\u00a0",
