    "description": "It\u2019s not easy to tread lightly wearing steel-toed boots.Sirantha Jax isn\u2019t known for diplomatic finesse. As a \u201cJumper\u201d who navigates ships through grimspace, she\u2019s used to kicking ass first and taking names later\u2014much later. Not exactly the obvious choice to sell the Conglomerate to the Ithtorians, a people whose opinions of humans are as hard as their exoskeletons.And Ithiss-Tor council meetings aren\u2019t the only place where Ambassador Jax needs to maneuver carefully. Her lover, March, is frozen in permanent \u201ckill\u201d mode, and his hair-trigger threatens to sabotage the talks\u2014not to mention their relationship.But Jax won\u2019t give up on the man or the mission. With the Outskirts beleaguered by raiders, pirates, and the flesh-eating Morgut, an alliance with Ithiss-Tor may be humanity\u2019s only hope.Which has Jax wondering why a notorious troublemaker like her was given the job.",
