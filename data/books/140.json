A great gig\u2014until information he brought back gave Axon the means to maximize profits by changing the past, present, and future of this world. \u00a0 If Axon succeeds, Tak will lose Samira Moheb, the woman he has loved since high school\u2014because her future will cease to exist. A veteran of the Iraq War suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, Samira can barely function in her everyday life, much less deal with Tak\u2019s ravings of multiple realities. The only way to save her is for Tak to use the time travel device he \u201cborrowed\u201d to transport them both to an alternate timeline. \u00a0 But what neither Tak nor Axon knows is that the actual inventor of the device is searching for a timeline called the Beautiful Land\u2014and he intends to destroy every other possible present and future to find it. \u00a0 The switch is thrown, and reality begins to warp\u2014horribly. And Tak realizes that to save Sam, he must save the entire world\u2026",
