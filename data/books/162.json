    "description": "The battle between boys and bots is on in this funny, fast-paced novel.Ken is an EngiNerd: one of a super-smart group of friends\u2014all nerds\u2014who have been close since kindergarten. They may be brainiacs, but they\u2019re just like everyone else: they fight with one another, watch too much TV, eat Chinese food, and hate walking their dogs. Well, maybe not just like everyone because Ken\u2019s best friend Dan has been building robots. He then secretly sent one to each of the EngiNerds, never letting them know he\u2019s the mastermind. At first Ken is awed and delighted: what kid hasn\u2019t dreamed of having a robot all their own? Someone who can be their friend, clean their room, walk the dog, answer homework questions\u2026how amazing is that? But be careful what you wish for: Dan\u2019s robot, Greeeg, may look innocent, but his ravenous consumption of food\u2014comestibles\u2014turns him into a butt-blasting bot. And once the other robots \u2018come alive\u2019 it\u2019s up to the motley crew of EngiNerds to not only save the day, but save the planet!",
