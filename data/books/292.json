    "description": "Two hundred years after civilization ended in an event known as the Blast, Benedikt isn't one to complain. He's got a job \u2014 transcribing old books and presenting them as the words of the great new leader, Fyodor Kuzmich, Glorybe \u2014 and though he doesn't enjoy the privileged status of a Murza, at least he's not a serf or a half-human four-legged Degenerator harnessed to a troika. He has a house, too, with enough mice to cook up a tasty meal, and he's happily free of mutations: no extra fingers, no gills, no cockscombs sprouting from his eyelids. And he's managed \u2014 at least so far \u2014 to steer clear of the ever-vigilant Saniturions, who track down anyone who manifests the slightest sign of Freethinking, and the legendary screeching Slynx that waits in the wilderness beyond.",
