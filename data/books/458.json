Just don\u2019t call it \u201ctime travel\u201d\u2015these historians \u201cinvestigate major historical events in contemporary time.\u201d And they aren\u2019t your harmless eccentrics either; a more accurate description, as they ricochet around history, might be unintentional disaster-magnets.From Tudor England to the burning city of Persepolis, from a medieval St. Mary\u2019s under siege to Victorian Rushford and a very nasty case of gaol fever, Max is struggling to keep her private life intact. There\u2019s an ambitious programme hindered by giant teapots, plus Mrs. Midgely\u2019s objection to dead hamsters in her airing cupboard, and Mr. Markham\u2019s stubborn refusal to reveal his exact marital status.And as if that\u2019s not enough\u2015the unfortunately not leprosy-laden Malcolm Halcombe is back. Admittedly, none of this is the most secure platform from which to launch an initiative to bring down the renegade Clive Ronan, but hey\u2015what\u2019s the worst that could happen?",
