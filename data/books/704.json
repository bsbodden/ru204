But they themselves are now in great danger, and so the wizard Stanislaus Pym hides the children at the Edgar Allan Poe Home for Hopeless and Incorrigible Orphans. There, he says, they will be safe.\u00a0How wrong he is.\u00a0 The children are soon discovered by their enemies, and a frantic chase sends Kate a hundred years into the past, to a perilous, enchanted New York City. Searching for a way back to her brother and sister, she meets a mysterious boy whose fate is intricately\u2014and dangerously\u2014tied to her own. Meanwhile, Michael and Emma have set off to find the second of the Books of Beginning.
