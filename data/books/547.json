But the island is also home to Margaret, a mysterious young orphan girl whose life is upturned when the cold, regal stranger arrives. As Margaret grows closer to Eleanor, she grapples with the revelation of the island\u2019s sinister true purpose as well as the truth of her own past. When Eleanor\u2019s life is threatened, Margaret is faced with a perilous choice between helping Eleanor and protecting herself.",
