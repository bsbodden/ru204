It never opened its doors, and for all that time, the townspeople have wondered why the ship landed there, and what\u2014or who\u2014could be inside. Then one day a government operative\u2014posing as a journalist\u2014arrives in town, asking questions. He discovers sixteen-year-old Annie Collins, one of the ship\u2019s closest neighbors and a local fixture known throughout the town, who has some of the answers. As a matter of fact, Annie Collins might be the most important person on the planet. She just doesn\u2019t know it.",
