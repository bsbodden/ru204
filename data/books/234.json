    "description": "Fifteen-year-old Zoe has a secret ability: she can travel back in time twenty-three minutes to relive events she wants to change. But Zoe has learned from experience that this is more curse than gift. Things almost never end well and people just tend to think she\u2019s crazy.But when she steps into a bank to get out of the rain and finds herself in the middle of a robbery gone horrifyingly wrong, Zoe knows she\u2019s the only one who can help. The problem is, she has only a limited number of tries to make things right. Plus, a single mistake could get her killed\u2014and not even time travel could bring her back from that.Zoe has always considered herself a loser, about as far from a heroine as a girl can get. Now she has to dig deep to find a strength she never thought she possessed.",
