Discovered practising his illegal reindeer dance and poo-dropping routine, our hero, along with fellow disaster-magnets Peterson and Maxwell, is despatched to Anglo-Saxon England to discover the truth about Alfred and the cakes.In his own words, our hero reveals Major Guthrie\u2019s six-point guide to a successful assignment and the Security Section\u2019s true opinion of the History Department. And of historians in general. And of one historian in particular.And, just to be clear, it is time travel, for God\u2019s sake. Forget all that pretentious \u2018investigating major historical events in contemporary time\u2019 rubbish.This is history without the capital \u2018H\u2019. Because this is the way the Security Section rolls!",
