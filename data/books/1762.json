And it isn\u2019t even the strangest thing to happen to him that week.Nick and his Dungeons & Dragons-playing friends are used to living in their imaginations. But when a new girl, Mia, joins the group and reality becomes weirder than the fantasy world they visit in their weekly games, none of them are prepared for what comes next. A strange\u2014yet curiously familiar\u2014man is following Nick, with abilities that just shouldn\u2019t exist. And this man bears a cryptic message: Mia\u2019s in grave danger, though she doesn\u2019t know it yet. She needs Nick\u2019s help\u2014now.He finds himself in a race against time to unravel an impossible mystery and save the girl. And all that stands in his way is a probably terminal disease, a knife-wielding maniac and the laws of physics.Challenge accepted.",
