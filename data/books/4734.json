Together we are much more powerful. But it could only last so long before we had to separate to find the others . . .I went to Spain to find Seven, and I found even more, including a tenth member of the Garde who escaped from Lorien alive. Ella is younger than the rest of us, but just as brave. Now we're looking for the others - including John.But so are they.I am Number Six. To finish what they started, they'll have to fight us first.",
