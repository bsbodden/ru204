    "description": "In Tokyo, sixteen-year-old Nao has decided there\u2019s only one escape from her aching loneliness and her classmates\u2019 bullying, but before she ends it all, Nao plans to document the life of her great-grandmother, a Buddhist nun who\u2019s lived more than a century. A diary is Nao\u2019s only solace\u2014and will touch lives in a ways she can scarcely imagine.Across the Pacific, we meet Ruth, a novelist living on a remote island who discovers a collection of artifacts washed ashore in a Hello Kitty lunchbox\u2014possibly debris from the devastating 2011 tsunami. As the mystery of its contents unfolds, Ruth is pulled into the past, into Nao\u2019s drama and her unknown fate, and forward into her own future.\u00a0Full of Ozeki\u2019s signature humour and deeply engaged with the relationship between writer and reader, past and present, fact and fiction, quantum physics, history, and myth, A Tale for the Time Being  is a brilliantly inventive, beguiling story of our shared humanity and the search for home.",
