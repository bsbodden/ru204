    "description": "With this outrageous new novel, China Mi\u00e9ville has written one of the strangest, funniest, and flat-out scariest books you will read this\u2014or any other\u2014year. The London that comes to life in Kraken is a weird metropolis awash in secret currents of myth and magic, where criminals, police, cultists, and wizards are locked in a war to bring about\u2014or prevent\u2014the End of All Things.In the Darwin Centre at London\u2019s Natural History Museum, Billy Harrow, a cephalopod specialist, is conducting a tour whose climax is meant to be the Centre\u2019s prize specimen of a rare Architeuthis dux\u2014better known as the Giant Squid. But Billy\u2019s tour takes an unexpected turn when the squid suddenly and impossibly vanishes into thin air.As Billy soon discovers, this is the precipitating act in a struggle to the death between mysterious but powerful forces in a London whose existence he has been blissfully ignorant of until now, a city whose denizens\u2014human and otherwise\u2014are adept in magic and murder.There is the Congregation of God Kraken, a sect of squid worshippers whose roots go back to the dawn of humanity\u2014and beyond. There is the criminal mastermind known as the Tattoo, a merciless maniac inked onto the flesh of a hapless victim. There is the FSRC\u2014the Fundamentalist and Sect-Related Crime Unit\u2014a branch of London\u2019s finest that fights sorcery with sorcery. There is Wati, a spirit from ancient Egypt who leads a ragtag union of magical familiars. There are the Londonmancers, who read the future in the city\u2019s entrails. There is Grisamentum, London\u2019s greatest wizard, whose shadow lingers long after his death. And then there is Goss and Subby, an ageless old man and a cretinous boy who, together, constitute a terrifying\u2014yet darkly charismatic\u2014demonic duo.All of them\u2014and others\u2014are in pursuit of Billy, who inadvertently holds the key to the missing squid, an embryonic god whose powers, properly harnessed, can destroy all that is, was, and ever shall be.",
