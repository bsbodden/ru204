It turns out, there\u2019s more than just the Empire for the good guys to worry about.\u201d\u2014The Hollywood ReporterAs the Empire reels from its critical defeats at the Battle of Endor, the Rebel Alliance\u2014now a fledgling New Republic\u2014presses its advantage by hunting down the enemy\u2019s scattered forces before they can regroup and retaliate. But above the remote planet Akiva, an ominous show of the enemy\u2019s strength is unfolding. Out on a lone reconnaissance mission, pilot Wedge Antilles watches Imperial Star Destroyers gather like birds of prey circling for a kill, but he\u2019s taken captive before he can report back to the New Republic leaders. Meanwhile, on the planet\u2019s surface, former rebel fighter Norra Wexley has returned to her native world\u2014war weary, ready to reunite with her estranged son, and eager to build a new life in some distant place. But when Norra intercepts Wedge Antilles\u2019s urgent distress call, she realizes her time as a freedom fighter is not yet over. What she doesn\u2019t know is just how close the enemy is\u2014or how decisive and dangerous her new mission will be. Determined to preserve the Empire\u2019s power, the surviving Imperial elite are converging on Akiva for a top-secret emergency summit\u2014to consolidate their forces and rally for a counterstrike. But they haven\u2019t reckoned on Norra and her newfound allies\u2014her technical-genius son, a Zabrak bounty hunter, and a reprobate Imperial defector\u2014who are prepared to do whatever they must to end the Empire\u2019s oppressive reign once and for all.",
