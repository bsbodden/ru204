    "description": "For years, the Marvel Universe has lived in fear that the artificial intelligence known as Ultron would one day evolve to fulfill its greatest desire: to wipe out all organic life and take over the Earth. That day has arrived! The impossible has happened and Ultron rules the planet! And as the few super hero survivors that remain try desperately to stay alive, Luke Cage learns the staggering secret of Ultron's victory. As a near-broken Captain America leads a ragtag counterattack, Wolverine makes a controversial and desperate decision - that creates an all-new Marvel Universe! But can even this rash act defeat Ultron? The event of the year has arrived!
