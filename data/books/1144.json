    "description": "Rebecca Wright has reclaimed her life, finding her way out of her grief and depression following a personal tragedy years ago. She spends her days working in customer support for the internet dating site where she first met her husband. But she has a strange, persistent sense that everything around her is somewhat off-kilter: she constantly feels as if she has walked into a room and forgotten what she intended to do there; on TV, the President seems to be the wrong person in the wrong place; her\u00a0dreams are full of disquiet. Meanwhile, her husband's decade-long dedication to his invention, the causality violation device (which he would greatly prefer you not call a \u201ctime machine\u201d) has effectively stalled his career and made him a laughingstock in the physics community. But he may be closer to success than either of them knows or can possibly imagine.Version Control is about a possible near future, but it\u2019s also about the way we live now. It\u2019s about smart phones and self-driving cars and what we believe about the people we meet on the Internet. It\u2019s about a couple, Rebecca and Philip, who have experienced a tragedy, and about how they help \u2014 and fail to help \u2014 each other through it.",
