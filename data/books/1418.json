    "description": "Pulitzer Prize finalist Lydia Millet\u2019s sublime new novel\u2014her first since the National Book Award long-listed Sweet Lamb of Heaven\u2014follows a group of twelve eerily mature children on a forced vacation with their families at a sprawling lakeside mansion.Contemptuous of their parents, who pass their days in a stupor of liquor, drugs, and sex, the children feel neglected and suffocated at the same time. When a destructive storm descends on the summer estate, the group\u2019s ringleaders\u2014including Eve, who narrates the story\u2014decide to run away, leading the younger ones on a dangerous foray into the apocalyptic chaos outside.As the scenes of devastation begin to mimic events in the dog-eared picture Bible carried around by her beloved little brother, Eve devotes herself to keeping him safe from harm.A Children\u2019s Bible is a prophetic, heartbreaking story of generational divide\u2014and a haunting vision of what awaits us on the far side of Revelation.",
