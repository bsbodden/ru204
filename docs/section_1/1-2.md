## Introducing RedisJSON
RedisJSON is a component within Redis Stack that allows the storage and manipulation of JSON documents within Redis. Once stored in Redis, individual or multiple properties can then be updated and retrieved and transformed from other operations similar to those expected from native Redis Data types.

RedisJSON allows users to store JSON at a single Redis key regardless of depth or child data types.  There are no additional keys or data structure mappings required. JSON document attributes can also be viewed and modified without retrieving the entire object - saving a lot of time and network bandwidth.

Here are some particular features of RedisJSON:
- Full support for the [JSON standard](https://json.org): JSON created and utilized by programming languages and their frameworks are natively stored in Redis
- A [JSONPath](https://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/) syntax for selecting/updating elements inside documents: individual and multiple values can be selected and retrieved using the JSONPath syntax.
- Documents stored as binary data in a tree structure, allowing fast access to sub-elements
- Typed atomic operations for all JSON values types


### Commands
RedisJSON employs the standard `GET` and `SET` commands to store and retrieve JSON documents in their partial or entire state.  Lists, Strings, objects (JSON sub-documents), and Numbers that exist within a JSON document all benefit from data-type specific commands native to RedisJSON.
