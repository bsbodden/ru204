# Hands-On Exercise: Storing JSON with Redis native data types

Throughout this exercise, we will use this simplified book JSON document as an example. This is an abbreviated form of the book JSON document found within this course's same data set.

```json
{
    "base_id": 18161,
    "title": "Obsidian",
    "pages": 999,
    "inventory": [
        {
            "stock_number": "18161_1",
            "status": "on_loan"
        },
        {
            "stock_number": "18161_3",
            "status": "maintenance"
        }
    ],
    "genres": {
        "Young Adult": 3439, 
        "Fantasy": 2545, 
        "Science Fiction (Aliens) ": 1648, 
        "Science Fiction": 1170
    }
}
```

## Strings
For this first exercise we will store Raw JSON in Redis as a String.

In RedisInsight or `redis-cli`, use the `SET` command to store Raw JSON as a string.

```bash
127.0.0.1:6379> SET JSON:serialized-string '{"base_id": 18161,"title": "Obsidian", "pages": 999, "inventory": [{"stock_number": "18161_1","status": "on_loan"},{"stock_number": "18161_3","status": "maintenance"}],"genres": {"Young Adult": 3439, "Fantasy": 2545, "Science Fiction (Aliens) ": 1648, "Science Fiction": 1170} }'
OK
127.0.0.1:6379> 
```

> Note that while Raw JSON is stored as a String within Redis, specific data types cannot be directly accessed or manipulated, as the format is a String primitive and is not recognized as an organized document


Retrieve the `JSON:serialized-string` with the `GET` command.

```bash
127.0.0.1:6379> GET JSON:serialized-string
"{\"base_id\": 18161,\"title\": \"Obsidian\", \"pages\": 999, \"inventory\": [{\"stock_number\": \"18161_1\",\"status\": \"on_loan\"},{\"stock_number\": \"18161_3\",\"status\": \"maintenance\"}],\"genres\": {\"Young Adult\": 3439, \"Fantasy\": 2545, \"Science Fiction (Aliens) \": 1648, \"Science Fiction\": 1170} }"
127.0.0.1:6379> 
```

This may be an adequate storage solution if an application uses predictably small JSON documents that do not need manipulation or sub-document access.
